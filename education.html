<h2>Education</h2>
<h4>Primary Education</h4>
<p>He received his primary education in the city of Porbandar.
 Being a famous and influential person, some people assume Gandhi was among 
the brightest students in his school. Contrary to this, Gandhi was an average student. 
He was not very good at academics or in any sporting activities, however, he grasped some 
of the most important aspects of his education including good morals. He was also a shy
and timid student. The school he went to was a school consisting of boys only and was located
on the Western Coast of India.

<h4>Higher School Education</h4>

Gandhi later moved to Rajkot, a city located in the western part of India.
The move was necessary due to his father's new job. He joined Alfred High School,
an all-boys school, at the age of 11 years. There was a lot of improvement in his performance
in high school compared to elementary school.

The <strong>young Gandhi</strong> who was not good at anything could now be recognized as a good 
student in various subjects including English. He did not excel in other areas such as Geography. 
He was still the same shy student but he still maintained the good conduct he had from a very young 
age. One thing that never changed was his handwriting. It was never pleasing. This is probably due to
the fact that he learned by writing on dust using his fingers.

His high school life was a challenge since he married at 13 years and had to take care of his
family. His father later got ill which was added a challenge to his life as well as his education.

Alfred High School was later renamed after Gandhi after India's independence. In 2017, the school was 
closed and converted to a museum.

<h4>College Education</h4>

Despite Mahatma Gandhi's education challenges during his high school years including being taken a year
back, Gandhi managed to complete his high school. He enrolled in Samaldas Arts College, the only 
institution that was offering a degree. Gandhi later dropped out of college and went back home to his 
family in Porbandar.

After some time, Gandhi decided to go back to college. He opted to take a different course, Law.
Since he had studied in India all his life, he decided to make a change and study in England. His 
decision was met with many challenges starting from his own family. His mother was not supportive of
him leaving India and the local chiefs excommunicated him. To put his family and other people who 
thought he would be influenced to go against his religion, he made a vow not to eat meat, drink
alcohol or get involved with other women.

He joined the University College London (UCL) and completed his Law degree successfully after
3 years. He managed to adapt to English culture while still honoring the vow he made to his family.
During his study in London, he managed to improve his shy nature when he joined a public speaking
group that trained him on how to be a good public speaker.

After graduating from UCL, Gandhi returned home to his family. Unfortunately,his mother had already
passed away.

With the education that Gandhi got from elementary school all the way to college, he managed to have
a successful career despite the challenges he faced.
